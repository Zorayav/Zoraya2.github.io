            <p>Hi! My name is Zoraya. I am from a small town in Arizona. I moved to Salt lake as a child. I am now 25
                with 3 girls. I discovered Tech Moms by another program I was doing for Data Analytics and thought I
                would give it a try and totally loved it! I plan on furthering my education in data. I enjoyed it quite
                a bit and hope to find a career in tech soon!
            </p>
